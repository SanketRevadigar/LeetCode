    #Time Complexity: O(Nâ‹…3L) where N is the number of cells in the board and L is the length of the word to be matched.
    #For the backtracking function, initially we could have at most 4 directions to explore, but further the choices are        reduced into 3 (since we won't go back to where we come from). As a result, the execution trace after the first step      could be visualized as a 3-ary tree, each of the branches represent a potential exploration in the corresponding          direction. Therefore, in the worst case, the total number of invocation would be the number of nodes in a full 3-nary      tree, which is about 3L.We iterate through the board for backtracking, i.e. there could be NNN times invocation for        the backtracking function in the worst case.
    #Space Complexity: O(L) where LLL is the length of the word to be matched
